IAM Summery:
-----------	
	->root account is simply the account created when first setup your aws account. it has complete admin access
	->new users have no permissions when first created.
	->new users are assigned access keyid & secret access keyid when first created.
	->these are not the same as password, and you cannot use the access keyid & secret access keyid to login to the console. you can use this           access aws via API's and command line however.
	->you only get to view these once. if you lose them, you have to regenerate them. so save them in a secure location
	->always setup MFA on your root account.
	->you can create and customize your own password rotation polocies.
